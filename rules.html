    <h1>Form Submission Rules</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Sharing this link is not allowed.</strong>
        <p>Sharing the form link with others can lead to multiple submissions by unauthorized individuals. Each participant is expected to complete the form only once.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Submitting more than once is not allowed.</strong>
        <p>Each participant is allowed to submit only one response. Any attempt to submit multiple entries will result in disqualification.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Using keyboard shortcuts (including Ctrl+I) is not allowed.</strong>
        <p>Using shortcuts like Ctrl+I (Inspect Element) or any other methods to alter form fields before submission violates the rules and can result in disqualification.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Using macros is not allowed.</strong>
        <p>Automating form submissions or using macros to fill out the form automatically will result in immediate disqualification.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Manipulating the form's HTML or JavaScript is prohibited.</strong>
        <p>Any attempt to alter the HTML structure, CSS, or JavaScript of the form to bypass validation or affect the submission will be considered as tampering with the system.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Falsifying information is strictly prohibited.</strong>
        <p>Entering false or misleading information, such as using someone elseâ€™s name or admission number, is a serious violation and can lead to disqualification.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Respect the integrity of the form.</strong>
        <p>The form is designed to maintain fairness. Do not attempt to exploit or bypass the system to alter your response or gain an unfair advantage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Submit only when you are sure of your vote.</strong>
        <p>Once submitted, you cannot change your vote. Make sure you are fully confident in your decision before finalizing your submission.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about these rules, please contact the club admins.</p>
